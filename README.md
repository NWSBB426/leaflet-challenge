Earthquake Map Visualization

Overview
This project involves creating an interactive web map to visualize earthquake data. The map displays earthquake occurrences over the past 7 days, sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake API. This application uses Leaflet, a JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps, and D3.js, a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.

Features
- Interactive Map: Utilizes Leaflet to render a dynamic map.
- Real-Time Data: Fetches real-time earthquake data for the past 7 days from the USGS Earthquake API.
- Data Visualization: Earthquake occurrences are represented as circle markers on the map, where the size and color of each marker correspond to the earthquake's magnitude and depth, respectively.
- Custom Legend: Includes a custom legend to indicate the depth categories of earthquakes.

Attempted Enhancements
- Depth Filter: An effort was made to implement a filter for selecting earthquakes based on depth (Shallow, Intermediate, Deep). While the initial implementation was set up, this feature could not be fully operational due to complexities encountered. This enhancement was considered above and beyond the primary objectives of the project.

Technologies Used
- Leaflet For rendering the interactive map.
- D3.js: For processing and visualizing data.
- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web page.
- JavaScript: For adding interactivity and managing data requests.

Data Source
- USGS Earthquake API: Provides data on earthquakes that occurred in the past 7 days globally. The API is robust and updates in real-time, making it an ideal source for this project.

Challenges and Learning
This project presented several learning opportunities, particularly in integrating various technologies like Leaflet and D3.js for data visualization. The most significant challenge was attempting to implement the depth filter functionality. While this feature remains incomplete, the process provided valuable insights into the complexities of interactive data visualization and the integration of various libraries and APIs.

Conclusion
This Earthquake Map Visualization project successfully demonstrates the power of combining geospatial data with web technologies to create meaningful and interactive data visualizations. The attempted depth filter feature, though not fully functional, points towards future enhancements and the potential for making this tool even more informative and user-friendly.
